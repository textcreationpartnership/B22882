         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHat ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his mercies from time to time beſtowed upon me, I will confeſs my ſins as did holy <hi>David,</hi> and I will weep for them as did the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and I will Faſt as did the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and I will Repent as did the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and I will wait with Patience as did Holy <hi>Job,</hi> till the appointed time which the Lord hath ſet for my Change.</p>
                  <p>IT is the Lord himſelf whoſe Word never failed, and whoſe compaſſion have no end; It is he that by his wonderful Providence, even when we were at the Pits brink, brought to light that moſt horrid Plot that the bloody-minded Papiſts had brought upon this Kingdom this laſt Year; for the which I bleſs and praiſe his Holy Name, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LOrd preſerve my gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> with all the loyal and religious hearts that ſtand up to defend the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and Lord I beſeech thee to bring to light all ſuch Plots as ever ſhall be plotted or imagined againſt them or this Nation; and that the Goſpel may by my Royal Soveraign be maintained unto his lifes end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LAy to thy helping hand, O Lord, and ſtrengthen my weak Condition, and pour the Oyl of thy grace into my wounded Conſcience, that I may ever walk in the light of thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo that at laſt I may receive comfort for my poor ſoul, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>MOſt gracious God, I have grievouſly ſinned; what ſhall I do, O thou preſerver of Men? O Lord I confeſs nothing can be hid from thy preſence; therefore I renounſing all merit in my ſelf, do beg thy Gracious Pardon through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom I was Redeemed, and it is he that hath made ſatisfaction for my ſins.</p>
                  <p>FOrget me not, O Lord, now I am Gray-headed, but Increaſe that little Grain of my weak and feeble Faith, and Direct it to the true Object, that is, the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and make me ſtrong therein, that when I ſhall leave this Body to the Grave, I may be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of a joyful reſurrection, in, and by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>ARm me, O Lord, I beſeech thee, with the Spiritual Shield of Faith againſt all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Eſtabliſh my hope, and good Lord keep me from Deſpair, ſo ſhall I be able to reſiſt the power of Sathan, and ſhall be comforted in thy mercies, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>REmember thy promiſe, O Lord, which thou haſt made unto Mankind, that if he will repent him of his ſins from the bottom of his heart, as did the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> thou wilt have mercy, therefore O Lord I beſeech thee again and again to have mercy on me, who with bended knees and unfeigned tears do beg thy gracious Pardon for Chriſt his ſake, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THough I have delighted in my ſins, which are more in number than the hairs upon my head, or the Sands on the Sea-ſhore, Lord I beſeech thee let thy Holy Spirit prepare me to a true and hearty ſorrow for them, and with thy moſt precious Blood waſh away all my ſinful ſpots; And this I beg for Chriſt his ſake, my onely Saviour and Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>HEar and accept of theſe my weak and humble petitions, O Lord, and for thy mercy ſake bow down thine ear and hear me that is become a Worm, and no Man, and I beſeech thee not to diſdain theſe my requeſts, but except me into thy favour, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IEſus thou the onely beloved Son of God, and Saviour of the whole World, who art the life of the Living, and the death of Death, and therefore both in Life and Death advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; which ſitteth at the Right Hand of God, making Interceſſion for all ſorrowful and penitent ſinners, to whom with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour and Glory, now and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>NOw will I draw my Name to a concluſion, and once more give thanks unto the <hi>Lord</hi> for all his abundant mercies in ſuch a wonderful manner from time to time beſtowed upon me, which am by reaſon of my wicked life, unworthy the leaſt of all his mercies; but it is his goodneſs that I had not been cut off by Death many years agone.</p>
